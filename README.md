# W.A.S.P

**Bug Tracking System** refers to an application that keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.

Many bug tracking systems, such as those used by most open-source software projects, allow end-users to enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are integrated with other project management software.
